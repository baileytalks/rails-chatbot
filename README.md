# A Simple Chatbot (Chat to the Alien Overlord) ðŸ‘½ðŸ‘½ðŸ‘½

Vlod, the alien overlord, has landed and wants to talk to you!

Use the chatbot to select your responses, and see if you can placate Vlod and save humankind.

If you're lucky enough to have admin access, go to the /admin page and create some potential messages for your users to select. The username is `admin` and the password is `alienz` (keep it to your yourself!).

## Getting started

To clone the repo and get started:
````
git clone git@github.com:baileytalks/rails-chatbot.git
cd rails-chatbot
bundle install
bin/rails db:create
bin/rails db:migrate

bundle exec rspec # Run the tests to ensure it works
bin/rails server # Start the server at localhost:3000
Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/
````

To create responses for your human users to go back to the alien overload (you'll need to do this in order to play the game!):
````
Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/messages`
Click `New Message`
Add a message and a threat level
Click `Create Message`
````

## Original Specification

Using:
* Ruby 2.4.1
* Rails 5.1.2
* Test framework: RSpec
* VCS: GIT

A user lands on the page and sends the first pre-written message to the bot (this is the root of the tree), they receive a response, for which they are then are presented with 2-3 optional possible pre-written messages to choose from to send back, each of which lead to a new 'response' from from the bot, and so on.

At particular points the response they choose may also lead to the end of the game (end is simply pass / fail).

All routes down the message tree should ultimately end in a pass/fail.

### Admin / backend:

* Authorisation system
* Ability to create / view /edit the messages and responses which form the chat flow
* Ability to mark a message the user receives as triggering the end of the game (with success or failure), otherwise the message received should give 2-3 possible responses the user will be able to choose

### User / Front end:

* First message from bot shown to user after short delay
* Available choices of response can be cycled through, allows user to pick one and 'send'
* Corresponding response message comes back from bot after short delay
* Repeat above steps until game end is triggered by one of the responses
* Present game end screen (pass / fail) and option to replay

### Bonus points:

Add some feature specs:
* Make it feel 'chatty' by implying the bot is typing during the delay periods
* Stats dashboard showing # of times game played, # times completed, # of wins, # of losses, # of replays and anything else you feel is appropriate
